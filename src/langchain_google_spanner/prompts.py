The following query in backtick matches all persons in the graph FinGraph

The following query in backtick finds the owner of the account with the most
incoming transfers by chaining multiple graph linear statements together.
```
GRAPH FinGraph
MATCH (:Account)-[:Transfers]->(account:Account)

The following query finds all the destination accounts one to three transfers
away from a source Account with id equal to 7.

that it is `[e:Transfers]->{{1, 3}}` and NOT `[e:Transfers*1..3]->`
